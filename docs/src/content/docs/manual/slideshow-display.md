title: Slideshow & display
description: Set how photos advance, when the screen sleeps, the language on the frame, and which screen-power backend it uses.
---

The slideshow and the screen's behavior are set on the **Settings** page, in two groups.
**Essentials** holds the photo rotation and pairing, the idle screen-off, the language, and the
reading labels. These apply the moment you save. **Display** holds the screen output and which
screen-power backend the frame uses. See [Configuration basics](/getting-started/configuration/)
for how saving and restarts work.

## The photo rotation

**Advance photo every** sets how long each photo stays on screen before the next one. The
default is two minutes (`slideshow.interval`).

**Shuffle photos** controls the order. With it off, photos cycle in the order you set on the
[Photos page](/manual/photos/#arranging-the-order). With it on, the order is reshuffled each full
pass (`slideshow.randomize`, off by default). Toggling it starts a fresh cycle at once, rather than
waiting for the current pass to finish.

## Split-screen pairing

A portrait photo on a landscape screen, or a landscape photo on a portrait screen, cannot fill
the frame without cropping away most of it. **Split-screen pairing** avoids that. When a photo's
shape is too far from the screen's to fit cleanly, the frame shows it beside another photo of the
same orientation, side by side with a thin gap, instead of cropping it. Photos that already fit
the screen show one at a time, full-frame.

The toggle is on by default (`slideshow.split_screen`). Turn it off to crop every photo to fill
the screen. A lone photo of its orientation, with no partner in the current pass, shows on its
own, cropped.

Pairing follows the screen, not a fixed setting: the frame reports its own dimensions, so turning
a frame to portrait pairs landscape photos instead. How far a photo's shape must differ before it
pairs is `slideshow.pair_threshold` in the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/),
and the default suits most screens.

## Blurred fill

**Blurred fill** is another way to avoid cropping: instead of pairing mismatched photos side by
side, each photo shows at its full, uncropped aspect ratio, with a heavily blurred and zoomed copy
of the same photo filling the gap on either side (or above and below, for a portrait photo on a
landscape screen).

The toggle is off by default (`slideshow.blurred_fill`). It works alongside split-screen pairing
rather than replacing it — a paired photo is shown uncropped already, so blurred fill mainly
affects lone photos whose shape doesn't match the screen.

## Turning the screen off when idle

**Turn screen off when idle** blanks the panel after a stretch with no motion, and motion
wakes it again (`display.blank_after`, twenty minutes by default). This is a true power-off of
the panel, not a black photo.

It needs a motion sensor. Without one the control reads **Never** and is disabled, since
nothing would be left to wake the screen. To turn the screen on and off by hand instead, use
the toggle on the [Dashboard](/manual/dashboard/) or the switch exposed to
[Home Assistant](/manual/home-assistant/).

:::note[Some TVs stay lit]
A monitor or a laptop panel cuts its backlight when the screen blanks. Some TVs ignore the
signal and stay lit on a black screen. Powering a TV down fully takes HDMI-CEC, which is
outside what the frame controls.
:::

## Language and labels

**Language** sets the locale the frame formats with, both the date wording and the 12- or
24-hour clock (`display.locale`, American English by default). It changes the frame, not the
admin interface.

**Time zone** sets the zone the clock and date follow (`display.timezone`). Left as **Browser
default** it uses the frame device's own zone, which is right for most setups. Pick an IANA zone,
such as `Europe/Budapest`, to pin the frame to a different place.

**Hide clock and date** removes the time and date from the frame (`display.hide_clock_date`, off
by default). With the clock hidden and no readings configured, the whole bottom overlay
disappears and you get just the photos. [The kiosk display](/manual/kiosk/) shows what hides.

**Reading labels** are the captions under the sensor readings on the frame, in your own words:
the outside reading, the inside reading, and humidity. Leave one blank to hide that caption.
[The kiosk display](/manual/kiosk/) shows where they appear.

## Screen-power backend

:::note[Advanced]
The default backend is the right choice for almost every setup. Change it only if you have a
specific reason to.
:::

The **backend** is how the frame powers the panel. Two options exist: **wlopm** (default,
recommended) and **vcgencmd** (a legacy fallback). wlopm is the more reliable path. vcgencmd
trims a little memory but can be less stable, so use it only if wlopm gives you trouble.

Each backend installs its own system services and boot configuration, so the **Backend**
dropdown in Settings does not switch between them on its own. To change the backend, re-run the
installer with its `--display-backend` flag (see [Install](/getting-started/install/)). It
reconfigures the system, and you reboot to apply. [The story & the hard parts](/development/story/)
covers why the two differ.

## Screen output

**Wayland output** is the display connector the wlopm backend targets, such as `HDMI-A-1`. Pick
a connected display from the list or type the name.

:::note[Restart required]
A change to the screen output takes effect after the frame restarts.
:::

## Screen rotation

**Rotation** turns the whole picture to match how the frame hangs: landscape, portrait
(rotated right or left), or upside down. It applies the moment you save, with no restart
(`display.rotation`, degrees counter-clockwise, default `0`).

Rotation changes what fits the screen, and the slideshow follows. On a portrait frame,
portrait photos fill the screen on their own, and [split-screen pairing](#split-screen-pairing)
pairs the landscape photos instead, stacked one above the other.

Rotation is available on the default `wlopm` backend only.

:::note[Installed before version 1.2.0?]
Rotation needs the `wlr-randr` tool and an updated browser launch script, which software
updates alone do not deliver. If the Rotation dropdown is greyed out, rerun the install
script from [Install](/getting-started/install/); it keeps your settings and photos.

Every setting on this page maps to a key in the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/).
